   @subsection tsk_d    Task Diagram
                        This task diagram below shows our initial idea for how to acheive the overall functions of the pen plotter
                        task.

   @subsection FSM_dr   Task Diagram
                        This schematic was then used to develop a kinematic relationship 
                        between the motion of the motor about point A and the motion of 
                        the platform about point O as shown below.
                        ## Drawing Task
